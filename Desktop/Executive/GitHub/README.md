# Webpage Summarizer

A Python-based tool that:
- Scrapes a webpage for text content.
- Saves the content to a text file.
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate an executive summary that even a 5-year-old can understand.

---

## Features
- Extracts text content from any webpage using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Summarizes the text with OpenAI's GPT models.
- Saves both the raw text and summary to files for easy reference.

---

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `openai`

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up Your OpenAI API Key**:
   - Obtain your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

---

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal or command line:
```bash
python Five_Year_Old.py <url> <output_filename>
```

### Example:
```bash
python Five_Year_Old.py "https://www.example.com" "output.txt"
```

### Outputs:
- `output.txt`: Contains the scraped text from the webpage.
- Console Output: The executive summary generated by GPT.

## Project Structure
- **`Five_Year_Old.py`**: Main script that combines scraping, saving, and summarizing.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

---

## Limitations
- Dynamic webpages that load content with JavaScript may not be fully supported. For such cases, consider using Selenium or Playwright.
- Summarization relies on the OpenAI API; ensure your API key has access to the necessary models.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for dynamic webpage scraping using Selenium.
- Provide an option to save both the summary and raw text in different formats (e.g., JSON, Markdown).
- Build a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
